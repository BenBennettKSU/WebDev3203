    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my IT 3203 Web Development project website. This site explores the
      Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). On this site, I share what I've learned about how HTTP has changed over time and why it matters today.
      You'll also see examples of my work with HTML and CSS as part of this research project.
    </p>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Since its invention by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s, HTTP has transformed how people access and share information on the internet. 
      What started as a simple way to load web pages has grown into a powerful system that supports everything from streaming videos to online shopping and cloud services. 
      With the introduction of HTTPS, our online activities are now safer and more private, helping us trust the websites we use every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      The transition from early, unencrypted browsing to today’s secure and high-performance web has shaped how
      people use technology every day. Whether someone is watching videos, working online, or messaging friends,
      HTTP remains the system that makes those interactions possible. As more devices connect to the internet,
      new versions of HTTP will continue to evolve to support the speed and security we now expect from modern
      digital life.
