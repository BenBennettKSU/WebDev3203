    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has evolved dramatically since its creation 
      by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s. What began as a simple way to request 
      and deliver hypertext documents has become a powerful, secure system 
      supporting everything from cloud computing to video streaming.
