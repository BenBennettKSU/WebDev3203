    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has evolved dramatically since its creation 
      by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s. What began as a simple way to request 
      and deliver hypertext documents has become a powerful, secure system 
      supporting everything from cloud computing to video streaming.
    </p>

    <h2>Major Versions of HTTP</h2>

    <ul> 
      <li><strong>HTTP/0.9 (1991):</strong> The very first version, supporting only simple GET requests and delivering raw HTML.</li>
      <li><strong>HTTP/1.0 (1996):</strong> Introduced status codes, headers, and support for different content types.</li>
      <li><strong>HTTP/1.1 (1997):</strong> Brought persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, and additional cache control mechanisms. This version remains widely used today.</li>
      <li><strong>HTTP/2 (2015):</strong> A major overhaul focusing on performance improvements, including multiplexing, header compression, and server push capabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>HTTP/3 (2020):</strong> Built on the QUIC transport protocol, HTTP/3 aims to reduce latency and improve connection reliability, especially in mobile and lossy network environments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>
      The evolution of HTTP reflects the changing needs of the web and its users. 
      Each version has introduced significant improvements in performance, security, 
      and functionality, enabling the rich, interactive experiences we expect today. 
      As the internet continues to grow and evolve, so too will the protocols that underpin it.
