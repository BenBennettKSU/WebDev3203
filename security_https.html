      <h2>HTTPS Overview</h2>

      <p>
        While HTTP made the web accessible, it originally had one major
        weakness: it transmitted data in plain text. This meant anyone
        intercepting the communication could read sensitive information such as
        passwords or credit card numbers. To fix this, HTTPS was created to add
        encryption and security to web communication.
      </p>

      <h2>How HTTPS Works</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Encryption:</strong> Converts readable data into a secure,
          unreadable format.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Authentication:</strong> Confirms that the website is who it
          claims to be through a digital certificate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Ensures that the information sent or
          received is not altered during transit.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why HTTPS Matters</h2>

      <p>
        HTTPS is a technology that most people use every day without realizing
        how important it is. Every time someone checks their bank account, makes
        an online purchase, or logs in to a website, HTTPS is working quietly in
        the background to protect their information. Without HTTPS, all of that
        data would travel across the internet in plain text. Any data sent in
        plaintext can be easily intercepted and read by malicious actors,
        putting users at risk of identity theft, fraud, and other cybercrimes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond protecting individuals, HTTPS also builds trust. When users see
        the padlock symbol in their browser, they know the site has a verified
        identity and that their data is encrypted. This trust is essential for
        e-commerce, online banking, and even basic communication platforms. In
        fact, modern browsers now warn users when a site doesn't use HTTPS,
        marking it as “Not Secure” to encourage better safety practices. As the
        internet continues to grow, HTTPS has become the default standard for
        all web traffic.
