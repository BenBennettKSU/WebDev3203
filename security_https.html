        <h2>HTTPS Overview</h2>

        <p> 
            While HTTP made the web accessible, it originally had one major weakness: it transmitted data in plain text. 
            This meant anyone intercepting the communication could read sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers.
            To fix this, HTTPS was created to add encryption and security to web communication.
        </p>

        <h2>How HTTPS Works</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Converts readable data into a secure, unreadable format.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Confirms that the website is who it claims to be through a digital certificate.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Ensures that the information sent or received is not altered during transit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Differences Between HTTP and HTTPS</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Feature</th>
                <th>HTTP</th>
                <th>HTTPS</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Security</td>
                <td>No encryption, data is sent in plain text.</td>
                <td>Data is encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Port</td>
                <td>Uses port 80.</td>
                <td>Uses port 443.</td>
            </tr>
           <tr>
                <td>Trust Indicator</td>
                <td>No lock icon in browser</td>
                <td>Displays a padlock symbol for secure connection</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Performance</td>
                <td>Faster initially but less secure</td>
                <td>Modern HTTPS (HTTP/2/3) improves both speed and security</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

         <h2>Why HTTPS Matters</h2>

         <p>
            HTTPS made secure online shopping, banking, and communication possible.
            Modern browsers even warn users when visiting a non-secure HTTP site.
            Today, HTTPS is considered the default standard for all web traffic.
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            HTTPS protects users by encrypting their data and verifying the identity of the sites they visit.
            It is the foundation of secure internet communication and a vital part of every modern website.
