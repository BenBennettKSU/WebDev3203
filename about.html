    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      My name is Ben Bennett. I am a Cybersecurity major at Kennesaw State University (KSU).
      I have a background in Computer Science from the University of Georgia (UGA), but I moved to KSU
      for its amazing cybersecurity program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to this background in information security, I wanted to do my project on HTTPS because it is a
      critical security element that is often taken for granted. It plays a vital role in protecting users and ensuring
      secure communication across the web.
    </p>

    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>
      This website was created for IT 3203 - Web Development at Kennesaw State University as part of
      Project Milestone 1. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of HTML and CSS to present research
      about the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its modern secure version, HTTPS.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project includes multiple pages covering the evolution of HTTP, security improvements through HTTPS, and modern
      web advances such as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. All pages share a consistent layout and are styled using a single CSS file.
    </p>
