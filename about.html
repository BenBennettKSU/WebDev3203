    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      My name is Ben Bennett. I am a Cybersecurity major at Kennesaw State University (KSU)
      and currently an Information Security Intern at Scientific Games, where I assist with projects
      involving network security, vulnerability management, and risk analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to this background in information security, I wanted to do my project on HTTP and therefore HTTPS because it is a
      critical security element that is often taken for granted. It plays a vital role in protecting users and ensuring
      secure communication across the web.
    </p>

    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>
      This website was created for IT 3203 - Web Development at Kennesaw State University as part of
      Project Milestone 1. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of HTML and CSS to present research
      about the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    </p>

    <p>
      The project includes multiple pages covering the evolution of HTTP, security improvements through HTTPS, and modern
      HTTP web advances.
