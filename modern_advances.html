    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      As the internet grew in scale and complexity, new versions of HTTP were developed
      to support faster data delivery, stronger security, and more efficient communication.
      Modern web technologies such as streaming, cloud computing, and real-time applications
      rely on these advancements to operate smoothly.
    </p>

    <h2>HTTP/2 Improvements</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Multiplexing:</strong> Allows multiple requests and responses to share a single connection.</li>
      <li><strong>Header Compression:</strong> Reduces redundant data to improve load times.</li>
      <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Lets browsers request critical resources first for faster rendering.</li>
      <li><strong>Binary Framing:</strong> Transmits data as compact binary instead of text for efficiency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>HTTP/3 and QUIC</h2>

    <p>
      HTTP/3 is built on a transport protocol called QUIC(Quick UDP Internet Connections),
      developed by Google. Unlike older versions that use TCP, QUIC runs on UDP, allowing faster
      connections with fewer delays and built-in encryption.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Zero-RTT Connection:</strong> Establishes secure communication almost instantly.</li>
      <li><strong>Stream Independence:</strong> Prevents one slow stream from blocking others.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrated Security:</strong> Combines encryption and transport setup in one step.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Performance Comparison</h2>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Feature</th>
        <th>HTTP/2</th>
        <th>HTTP/3</th>

      <tr>
        <td>Security</td>
        <td>TLS 1.2 or 1.3</td>
        <td>TLS 1.3 integrated into QUIC</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Latency</td>
        <td>Moderate</td>
        <td>Low, even on mobile networks</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>The Future of HTTP</h2>

    <p>
      The evolution of HTTP continues as developers aim to balance speed and security.
      Future updates may focus on adapting to new challenges such as quantum computing,
      which could impact encryption standards, and the continued growth of global cloud and mobile traffic.
      HTTP remains at the center of how the web communicates, constantly improving to meet new demands.
